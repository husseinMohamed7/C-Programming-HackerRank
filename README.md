# C Programming Problems on HackerRank

## Description

This repository contains my solutions to various C programming challenges on HackerRank. Each solution is implemented in C and follows the problem-solving requirements as outlined on HackerRank.

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to various C programming problems, aimed at helping others learn and understand different coding techniques and problem-solving strategies. I also welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement, as I strive to enhance my coding skills.

## Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific problem on HackerRank. The folder name follows the format `problem-name/`, and inside each folder, you will find:

- `solution.c`: The C code solution for the problem.
- `README.md`: A brief explanation of the problem and the approach used to solve it.

Example structure:
